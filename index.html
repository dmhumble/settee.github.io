			 <p>one of the things i&rsquo;m really interested in doing is setting up a very fast local network attached ai rendering farm for all things audio, images and video. for now i&rsquo;m playing with things like <a href="https://jan.ai">jan.ai</a> to see what kind of token performance i can get, will maybe go llmstudio.</p>

			 <p>6:23am, been awake since 6am I seem to wake when the sunrises recently which isn’t a bad thing the rest of my sleep is good.</p>
<p>took this shot the other day of this incredibly neat and integrated work station in a store in the expensive creams and lotions section</p>
<p>I have a thing for compact, neat, ready to go workstations and old timey steamer trunks crossovers.</p>
<p>I realise this is not a steamer trunk but it gave me vibes. from on the ground events to moving house or taking equipment on location I love the idea of opening and your on.</p>
<p>hopefully one day I get to build out that vision, kitted out, wheels and everything. bit like that on location audio sound carts you see but a step up from that.</p>

			 <p>just built a little tool to check .json files of a mapping service using ai and it built me the whole script to run on one of my 24/7 cloud servers and then sends me stuff via pushbullet when things trigger, if there is one thing about living in technology, it&rsquo;s bending data to make life better.</p>

			 <p>first time i&rsquo;ve ever heard of WHIP (WebRTC-HTTP Ingestion Protocol) instead of RTMP the world has certainly come a long way in terms of streaming protocols and the software/platforms that support them, it&rsquo;s like landing on a new planet, star trek style. ingesting, recalibrating.</p>

			 <p>if you are using micro.blog i suggest using .webp images for small file size for speedy loading, maybe you can do this auto with hugo i&rsquo;m not sure but i do it locally with <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/clop">lowtechguys.com/clop</a> and it&rsquo;s only $15 for a lifetime license! so clutch, dropzones, watch folders. get yo optimized!</p>

			 <p>i wonder how many people have been activated by using ai? like the dreams and creatives that could not code but could plug in cables in their minds like old telephone exchanges? it&rsquo;s a new era, everyday seems like a new golden age. is this a new era of distributed abundance or self destruction?</p>

			 <p>long week, felt that way.</p>
<p>still waiting, still in holding position.</p>
<p>there is nothing worse than having to wait for something for someone that just wants to go.</p>
<p>this is a different kind of slow thou, it&rsquo;s just slow to access the finances so i can start deploying the things around me that make you feel like your established in your base.</p>
<p>in my mind this weekend i&rsquo;m going rollerskating and i have all my protective wear on.</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s just a waiting game but i feel like i&rsquo;m operating on impulse power right now, for the last year even, i&rsquo;ve been learning tons about ai but it&rsquo;s certainly the time to execute and build.</p>
<p>i want my life on autopilot so i have more time for content creation and videoblogging again.</p>
<p>currently playing around with clop which is a great tool for compressing images and video and it&rsquo;s cheap, i tried a bunch of others but they had real trouble with .mkv files.</p>
<p>been finding a bunch of communities and lo-fi platforms that are exciting me that we are moving away from web2 and into web3 &ndash; bluesky and it&rsquo;s AT protocol are kind of making me realise how much more freedom we have and things like micro.blog allow me to cross post and continue conversations across the web.</p>
<p>the near future of social media is bright.</p>
<p>hope you have an awesome weekend!</p>

			 <p>Another meerkat Wednesday rolls into view.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d get to do in the future. I wonder if weeks are even talked about; maybe it&rsquo;s just a number now, a time slice, a countdown between the light and dark and the next meteor shower.</p>
<p>Perhaps Swatch came racing back to the front and deployed their swatch time in some futuristic quantum attempt to be the provider of all-time tracking across the known multiverse.</p>
<p>just writing in the hope that some of my current self makes it out there to my future self or maybe that can influence me back if we have time patterns that both go forward and back and can be a relay station to ever generational nexus ribbon of lives we touched.</p>
<p>the air quality outside is bad today, well not bad, but orange, not good, wildfires you see, feeling very matrix skies are darkened by the very machines that made this image probably. the rub of creativity is the cost to the unseen i guess always.</p>
<p>vibes are matched at the moment, down vibes, wish they vibes were unmatched but they match the usual pattern(s) of a current downward trend.  trying to focus on my mental health, getting some advice hopefully there, exercise and sleep is the order of the day currently.</p>
<p>i have no doubt i&rsquo;ll be having a brown bag round of interactions relatively soon.</p>

			 <p>one of the things that really stands out to me from moving a different country is the small things, the bugs you’ve never seen, the measuring in feet and not metres. It’s a reminder that you don’t know everything and to always be in learning mode.</p>

			 <p>apple has all the data all the time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>whenever they want to cash in on growth or an industry or entertainment they can just run the metrics, spit out a result and then start engineering a solution to their needs. i&rsquo;ve seen it with the way they watch the android eco system and their own apps from makers that just take off and they just quietly fold into a new os version.</p>
<p>how many times have you caught yourself saying, &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s _____ dead&rdquo; and they do this with the precision of a fleet of ninjas.  now it looks like they are folding both time and space to go after the kpop market.</p>
<p>content on apple so far in the majority of things i have watched just does not miss. they have the tech, the hardware, the &ldquo;seo&rdquo; of every little tuned interaction.</p>
<p>part of me winces in pain at the notion that that small open source developer with an idea got squeezed, probably got asked, but ultimately got rail roaded and flattened down like a jug handle town around route 66, just a blur in the distance from the new super highway.</p>
<p>no time for reflection thou, this is just forward motion progress for right or wrong, no point allowing what went before in my generation and the legacy and lag of my opinions of the &ldquo;change&rdquo; &ndash; time is not waiting for anyone.</p>
<p>get onboard the apple train, it&rsquo;s a freaking juggernaut.</p>

			 <p>i went for my usual walk this morning; something felt different. Maybe it was the slipping into my generation&rsquo;s music which released something, but I ended up walking for double the amount of time. I was in a flow mental state. It&rsquo;s interesting how the generation you grew up in never truly lets go.</p>
