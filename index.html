			 <p>gotta look back and forward a few days, what you been doing, what you not achieved yet and what&rsquo;s the near future look like.</p>
<p>right now, my life for the next few years looks BUSY.</p>
<p>life demands, i feel the work to get here was just the start, i&rsquo;m certainly feeling that what we achieved so far was a mammoth task for both of us especially as we are both very bad at SLOW and PAPER.</p>
<p>but we made it through and i&rsquo;m thankful, even playing field, everyone get&rsquo;s a chance.</p>
<p>the world is literally a connected playground, i can feel the buzz (maybe that&rsquo;s just the generators running diesel keeping the ai cloud going)</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m struggling to focus on just learning in the old way just to acquire a pay range at a job.</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t feel right to work inside of a company with the limiting factors of what software provider they use.</p>
<p>unless something dynamic comes across my lap or realm of interest i think building out some long term ideas is the way forward or just optimizing where their is gaps and inefficiency.</p>
<p>there is so much room for creative thinking and thinking fast and delivering tools that are life assistive.</p>

<p>custom unique places and spaces, open source, everyone can get onboard, remix, reimagine, imagination firing on all verses all at once, a pseudo imaging of a previous (safe space?) while growing up, a faux operating system inside a browser running on an operating system, the lines of &ldquo;where i am on the web&rdquo; are blurring, ai coding an pseudo operating system inside of a browser is just like virtualized dreaming.</p>
<p>i feel like those creatives that have wanted to code but got bogged down with the details will now have the freedom to imagine and pull on their experiences to combine things like a fine chef &ndash; in the moment, in real time, location based, mood based, physical input based, inspired by having a conversation with an ai to explore the edges and to build connective tissue between information and experiences of the creator and the viewer.</p>
<p>the lines blur for me there.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m reminded when i see videos like these about how far we have come, how far technology has moved past the limitations and accelerated into this new frontier where is feels like anything is possible and we have the phone book to the connected planet at our finger tips, no longer is it i &ldquo;might know a person&rdquo; &ndash; i don&rsquo;t even have to have any relationship to that person anymore and i can query the knowledge in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>i feel it&rsquo;s important almost now to forget everything i knew in many regards, every gripe, every frustration, every story of how it used to be so that the new frontier can get better value out of how i perceive these new tools. the ethics and morals remain but the frustrations and the rejection feeling of not knowing how it could work for me and my teenager brain need to be rewritten, the technology playing field is flattened.</p>

			 <p>6:23am, been awake since 6am I seem to wake when the sunrises recently which isn’t a bad thing the rest of my sleep is good.</p>
<p>took this shot the other day of this incredibly neat and integrated work station in a store in the expensive creams and lotions section</p>
<p>I have a thing for compact, neat, ready to go workstations and old timey steamer trunks crossovers.</p>
<p>I realise this is not a steamer trunk but it gave me vibes. from on the ground events to moving house or taking equipment on location I love the idea of opening and your on.</p>
<p>hopefully one day I get to build out that vision, kitted out, wheels and everything. bit like that on location audio sound carts you see but a step up from that.</p>

			 <p>long week, felt that way.</p>
<p>still waiting, still in holding position.</p>
<p>there is nothing worse than having to wait for something for someone that just wants to go.</p>
<p>this is a different kind of slow thou, it&rsquo;s just slow to access the finances so i can start deploying the things around me that make you feel like your established in your base.</p>
<p>in my mind this weekend i&rsquo;m going rollerskating and i have all my protective wear on.</p>
<p>i know it&rsquo;s just a waiting game but i feel like i&rsquo;m operating on impulse power right now, for the last year even, i&rsquo;ve been learning tons about ai but it&rsquo;s certainly the time to execute and build.</p>
<p>i want my life on autopilot so i have more time for content creation and videoblogging again.</p>
<p>currently playing around with clop which is a great tool for compressing images and video and it&rsquo;s cheap, i tried a bunch of others but they had real trouble with .mkv files.</p>
<p>been finding a bunch of communities and lo-fi platforms that are exciting me that we are moving away from web2 and into web3 &ndash; bluesky and it&rsquo;s AT protocol are kind of making me realise how much more freedom we have and things like micro.blog allow me to cross post and continue conversations across the web.</p>
<p>the near future of social media is bright.</p>
<p>hope you have an awesome weekend!</p>

			 <p>Another meerkat Wednesday rolls into view.</p>
<p>I wonder if that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d get to do in the future. I wonder if weeks are even talked about; maybe it&rsquo;s just a number now, a time slice, a countdown between the light and dark and the next meteor shower.</p>
<p>Perhaps Swatch came racing back to the front and deployed their swatch time in some futuristic quantum attempt to be the provider of all-time tracking across the known multiverse.</p>
<p>just writing in the hope that some of my current self makes it out there to my future self or maybe that can influence me back if we have time patterns that both go forward and back and can be a relay station to ever generational nexus ribbon of lives we touched.</p>
<p>the air quality outside is bad today, well not bad, but orange, not good, wildfires you see, feeling very matrix skies are darkened by the very machines that made this image probably. the rub of creativity is the cost to the unseen i guess always.</p>
<p>vibes are matched at the moment, down vibes, wish they vibes were unmatched but they match the usual pattern(s) of a current downward trend.  trying to focus on my mental health, getting some advice hopefully there, exercise and sleep is the order of the day currently.</p>
<p>i have no doubt i&rsquo;ll be having a brown bag round of interactions relatively soon.</p>

<p>whenever they want to cash in on growth or an industry or entertainment they can just run the metrics, spit out a result and then start engineering a solution to their needs. i&rsquo;ve seen it with the way they watch the android eco system and their own apps from makers that just take off and they just quietly fold into a new os version.</p>
<p>how many times have you caught yourself saying, &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s _____ dead&rdquo; and they do this with the precision of a fleet of ninjas.  now it looks like they are folding both time and space to go after the kpop market.</p>
<p>content on apple so far in the majority of things i have watched just does not miss. they have the tech, the hardware, the &ldquo;seo&rdquo; of every little tuned interaction.</p>
<p>part of me winces in pain at the notion that that small open source developer with an idea got squeezed, probably got asked, but ultimately got rail roaded and flattened down like a jug handle town around route 66, just a blur in the distance from the new super highway.</p>
<p>no time for reflection thou, this is just forward motion progress for right or wrong, no point allowing what went before in my generation and the legacy and lag of my opinions of the &ldquo;change&rdquo; &ndash; time is not waiting for anyone.</p>
<p>get onboard the apple train, it&rsquo;s a freaking juggernaut.</p>
